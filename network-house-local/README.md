network-house
=============

The network stack extracted from the [House](https://code.google.com/p/pdxhouse/) project.

Provides data structures and parsers for Ethernet, TCP, UDP, IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, DHCP and TFTP packets as well as some server implementations.

This package was extracted from house due to the lack of existing network package parsing libraries.
